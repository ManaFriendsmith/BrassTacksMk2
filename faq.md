# Can I add this to an existing playthrough? #

I mean, you can do whatever you want. You'll have to tear down and rebuild massive parts of your base though.

In Space Age, due to changes to ammo and thruster oxidizer recipes and the addition of new asteroid types that won't be in the target list of filtered gun turrets, all existing space platforms will probably get quickly destroyed or stranded if you add Brass Tacks or BrimStuff to a save that doesn't have them.

For these reasons and the simple fact that the mods are designed to be played from the start of a new world, I haven't included functionality like the ability to spawn resource patches in already-generated chunks. If you're fine with exploring new land for basic resources or spawning them in with the editor, rebuilding all your ships and most of your base, then sure, go ahead. It doesn't come highly recommended though.

# Is this compatible with 1.1 saves that had the MK. 1 version of this mod? #

Sort of but not really. I've made small changes across the board like reworking how the difficulty system works, adding a few new items, moving intermediates between difficulty levels or even mods, removing items that were annoying, etc.

In particular this version of the mod no longer has overhaul support.

If you want to continue an old save in 2.0, the incredible [Ashier](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Ashier) has created a series of forks of my original 1.1 mods that are compatible with 2.0 (but NOT SPACE AGE) without changing the old recipe progression.

# What happened to compatibility with Space Exploration / Krastorio? #

The simple fact of the matter is this: I want to have more hobbies other than gaming, I want to play games other than factorio, I want my time with factorio to not be 100% spent on modding, and I want my time spent on modding to not be 100% spent on compatibility.

I was not having a good time whenever another overhaul-compatible-with-other-overhauls came along and I had to double the number of possible combinations of Systematic Systems of ore processing (none of which talk to each other) that I had to account for.

If you make a bridge mod I will happily link to it, and if you make a compatibility patch I will happily incorporate it into the mod (provided you are OK with your work becoming Public Domain), I just really don't want to be on the hook for maintenance.

# How is your series distinct from BZ mods? #

There's a lot of overlap between what More Materials and BZ are doing. BZ was the direct inspiration for this series! If I had to point to a singular divergence in design ethos, it's this:

- BZ is more about *material processing,* managing byproducts and preventing deadlocks, and diversity of resources.
- More Materials is more about *crafting,* building compact and efficient setups for multi-step production chains, and diversity of mechanical doodads you have to make out of a more limited (but still larger than vanilla) set of resources.

Someone who prefers the BZ style might instead say BZ is more streamlined and focuses on logistical challenges and More Materials just makes you do a ton of fiddly busywork in between the resources coming out of the furnaces and being turned into final products, and probably wouldn't even be wrong!

# I want to contribute something #

That's kind of you. I am gradually catching up on this newfangled """""git hub""""" thing but have absolutely no clue how to use it as anything more complicated or collaborative than a basic progress logger and backup. Please DM me on the forums or Discord. (Fair warning: I can be incredibly flaky.)
