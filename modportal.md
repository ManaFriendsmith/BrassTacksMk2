# IMPORTANT NOTICE #

If you are looking for the 1.1 mod, look [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BrassTacks).

If you are looking for a 2.0 update of the 1.1 mod that works with all the overhauls it used to and is compatible with old saves, look [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BrassTacks-Updated)

This version is not currently compatible with Krastorio, Space Exploration, whatever seventeenth name we're calling 248k by now, etc.

It is semi backwards compatible with old saves depending on how much rebuilding you want to do.

It IS compatible with Space Age but requires a [separate mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pf-sa-compat).

Rebuilding overhaul compatibility might come at some future stage but it is not immediately planned.

# Basic Features #

- Zinc ore generates in new worlds. Zinc plates are primarily alloyed with copper to make brass, but are also needed to make batteries and galvanized items.
- Brass is an integral part of many early game items like gears, pipes, and ammo. Gears are also needed in some more products than before.
- A greater variety of intermediate products, depending on the difficulty.
- Start new freeplay games with a stack of brass to alleviate burner phase grind.

# Series #

This mod is part of the More Materials series. Similar to the BZ series, each mod adds a resource to the game and you can mix and match them to achieve your desired level of complexity.

- [Brass Tacks](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BrassTacksMk2) - Zinc, brass, mechanical parts
- [If I Had a Nickel](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IfNickelMk2) - Nickel, invar, motors and valves
- [Them Thar Hills](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ThemTharHillsMk2) - Gold and electronics
- [BrimStuff](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BrimStuffMk2) - Sulfur and chemistry
- [LasingAround](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LasingAroundMk2) - Helium and lasers

# Difficulty Breakdown #

All More Materials mods provide different difficulty levels, controlled by a mod setting in the PF functions dependency.

## Minimal Difficulty ##

Adds zinc, brass, and galvanized steel plates to the early game. Bearings are unlocked with blue science and are needed for more advanced machinery.

With Space Age, Brassteroids will spawn in space, allowing you to obtain brass to craft ammo. Later they can be separated into pure copper and zinc ores.

Zinc can be obtained from special bacteria on Gleba, from recycling on Fulgora, and from volcanic sphalerite produced as a byproduct of normal processes on Vulcanus.

## Moderate Difficulty ##

Adds a wide variety of machine parts to spaghettify your base: Pipe flanges, linkages, flywheels, hardened hulls, gearboxes, gyroscopes, and complex joints.

Generally, things are a bit more expensive. Some of the recipe changes are eased with Space Age, to make the transition to other planets smoother.

## Maximal Difficulty ##

There are now more galvanized parts to make, with a dedicated electroplating machine to do it in.

The affordances to make Space Age easier are undone, and there are now Spurving Bearings to mass produce on Vulcanus.

With If I Had a Nickel, advanced Brassteroid processing becomes a complex process with several byproducts.
